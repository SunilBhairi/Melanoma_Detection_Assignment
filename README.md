# Build the Model to accurately detect Melonoma 
Problem statement: 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Objective
To build an efficient CNN model that can:
1. Accurately classify dermoscopic images into the aforementioned disease categories.
2. Provide reliable assistance in diagnosing melanoma, reducing the risk of delayed or incorrect diagnoses.

## The data set contains the following diseases:
1. Actinic keratosis
2. Basal cell carcinoma
3. Dermatofibroma
4. Melanoma
5. Nevus
6. Pigmented benign keratosis
7. Seborrheic keratosis
8. Squamous cell carcinoma
9. Vascular lesion

## Model Architecture
  We will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The architecture will include the following layers:
* Convolutional Layer
* Activation Layer (ReLU)
* Pooling Layer (MaxPooling)
* Fully Connected Layer (Dense)
* Output Layer with Softmax Activation
* Steps to Build the Model

## Data Preprocessing:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset, including resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation.
2. Model Building: Define the CNN architecture using frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras.
3. Model Training: Train the model on the training dataset and validate it on the validation dataset.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Model Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

## Technologies Used
1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow / Keras
3. NumPy
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn
7. Augumentor 
8. CNN Libraries

## Key Details:
1. Images were categorized based on ISIC classifications.
2. Subsets were balanced except for melanomas and moles, which are slightly overrepresented in the dataset.

## Conclusions
1. Model built with class imbalance
   - This model is definately overfitting and also its not able to achive the higher accuracy due the class imbalance.
   - one class can have proportionately higher number of samples compared to the others. Class imbalance can have a detrimental effect on the final model quality.
2. Using Keras Augumentor  
  - in the conv Layer,even though the results  and the graph shows We have reduced the overfitting at certain level by adding Augumentation to the model,
    but its not able to achive the higher accuracy due the class imbalance.
3. Using Augumented Data - Removed class imbalance
  - model is working and providing the great results both on the training and Testing data. The class rebalance activity really helped the model in achieving the accuracy on both Train and Test

## Results
The model will provide:
1. Predictions for each image, indicating the likelihood of melanoma or other diseases.
2. Metrics evaluating the modelâ€™s performance.

## Challenges
1. Imbalanced data distribution may lead to biased predictions.
2. High variability in dermoscopic images (e.g., lighting, angles).

## Recommendations

1. Data Handling:

    1. Increase the dataset size by including more images of rare classes to balance the dataset.
    2. Collaborate with dermatologists to validate model predictions and improve accuracy.

2. Model Improvements:

   1. Use ensemble techniques by combining predictions from multiple models.
   2. Implement attention mechanisms to highlight critical regions in the image.

3. Real-World Testing:

   1. Test the model in clinical settings with real-world data to validate performance.
   2. Obtain feedback from dermatologists to iteratively refine the model.

4. Ethical Considerations:

   1. Ensure the model adheres to privacy standards when handling patient data.
   2. Clearly communicate the model's limitations and avoid over-reliance on its predictions.

5. Future Enhancements:

   1. Integrate with medical imaging systems for seamless deployment.
   2. Expand to detect other skin conditions and diseases beyond the current scope.
